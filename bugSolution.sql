The following code demonstrates a corrected approach using a CTE to join multiple tables and handle the data correctly.

```sql
WITH subquery AS (
    SELECT column1 FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column2 FROM table2
)
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM subquery sq
INNER JOIN table3 a ON sq.column1 = a.id
INNER JOIN table4 b ON sq.column1 = b.id;
```
This solution uses a CTE to explicitly define the subquery's result and then uses appropriate JOIN clauses to correctly join it with other tables based on the relevant IDs.
