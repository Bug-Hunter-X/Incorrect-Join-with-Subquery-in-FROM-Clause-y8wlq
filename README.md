This repository contains an example of a common SQL error involving incorrect joining of tables when using a subquery in the FROM clause. The provided SQL query attempts to select data from multiple tables using a subquery. However, the subquery returns multiple rows, which leads to ambiguous joins and erroneous results. The `bug.sql` file demonstrates this error, while `bugSolution.sql` offers a corrected approach.

The issue arises from incorrectly assuming a subquery that returns multiple rows can be directly joined as a single table in the outer query. To fix it, the subquery needs to be properly integrated into the JOIN conditions using appropriate techniques, such as common table expressions (CTEs) or explicit joins. The corrected solution uses a CTE to improve readability and maintainability.
