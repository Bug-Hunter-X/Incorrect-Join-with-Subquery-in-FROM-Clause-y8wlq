The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to select data from multiple tables, but it does not correctly handle the joining of those tables.  The subquery returns multiple rows, which is then incorrectly treated as a single table in the outer query.

```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM (SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column2 FROM table2) AS subquery,
table3 a, table4 b
WHERE a.id = subquery.column1 AND b.id = subquery.column1;
```
